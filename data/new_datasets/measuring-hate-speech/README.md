Dataset card for Measuring Hate Speech

This is a public release of the dataset described in Kennedy et al. (2020) and Sachdeva et al. (2022), consisting of 39,565 comments annotated by 7,912 annotators, for 135,556 combined rows. The primary outcome variable is the "hate speech score" but the 10 constituent ordinal labels (sentiment, (dis)respect, insult, humiliation, inferior status, violence, dehumanization, genocide, attack/defense, hate speech benchmark) can also be treated as outcomes. Includes 8 target identity groups (race/ethnicity, religion, national origin/citizenship, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, political ideology) and 42 target identity subgroups, as well as 6 annotator demographics and 40 subgroups. The hate speech score incorporates an IRT adjustment by estimating variation in annotator interpretation of the labeling guidelines.

This dataset card is a work in progress and will be improved over time.
Key dataset columns

    hate_speech_score - continuous hate speech measure, where higher = more hateful and lower = less hateful. > 0.5 is approximately hate speech, < -1 is counter or supportive speech, and -1 to +0.5 is neutral or ambiguous.
    text - lightly processed text of a social media post
    comment_id - unique ID for each comment
    annotator_id - unique ID for each annotator
    sentiment - ordinal label that is combined into the continuous score
    respect - ordinal label that is combined into the continuous score
    insult - ordinal label that is combined into the continuous score
    humiliate - ordinal label that is combined into the continuous score
    status - ordinal label that is combined into the continuous score
    dehumanize - ordinal label that is combined into the continuous score
    violence - ordinal label that is combined into the continuous score
    genocide - ordinal label that is combined into the continuous score
    attack_defend - ordinal label that is combined into the continuous score
    hatespeech - ordinal label that is combined into the continuous score
    annotator_severity - annotator's estimated survey interpretation bias
