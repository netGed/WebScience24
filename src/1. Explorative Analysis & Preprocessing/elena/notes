Possible research questions: 

# Traditional ML-Mehtods

1. Unsupervised Learning 
What patterns or themes emerge from hate speech data when using topic modeling (e.g., LDA) to analyze unlabelled tweets?

2. Supervised Learning
How do different supervised learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees) compare in detecting hate speech?
    What features (e.g., word embeddings, character n-grams, TF-IDF) contribute most to the performance of supervised models in hate speech detection?
    What is the impact of using imbalanced datasets on the performance of supervised models for hate speech detection, and how can techniques like SMOTE help?


## DL-Methods

(how) can a convolutional neural network (CNN) (be utilized to) effectively identify hate speech in short text snippets, such as tweets?
What role do data augmentation techniques play in enhancing the performance of deep learning models for hate speech detection?
